Intelligent IoT sensing system for rail vehicle tracks cracks detection system  introduces an automated detection mechanism using ultrasonic sensor temperature sensor and vibration sensor to detect the railway tracks for cracks obstacles. The ESP8266 microcontroller processes the sensor data, and displaying real-time information on an LCD. In case of any detected anomaly, the IoT module sends an alert to the authorities while the buzzer provides immediate audible warning, information to ESP8266.
